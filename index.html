                <h3>Educational Standards and Media Literacy</h3>
                    <p>Integrating Media Literacy Across the Curriculum <br>
                    Media literacy is most successful when it is integrated across the curriculum and, thus, related to national, state<br>
                    or district educational standards and assessment rubrics.<br>
                    CML's experience with Project SMARTArt demonstrated that, given training and practice through professional development, <br>
                    teachers can easily integrate curricula, devising lessons that incorporate CML's media literacy framework while meeting state education standards <br>
                    in at least three subjects in as little as 20 minutes.

         <h3>Empowerment through Education</h3>
        <p>
                    For 500 years, since the invention of moveable type, we have valued the ability to read and write as the primary means of communicating and <br>
                    understanding history, cultural traditions, political and social philosophy and the news of the day. <br>
                    In more recent times, traditional literacy skills ensured that individuals could participate fully as engaged citizens and functioning adults in society. 
                    <br>Today families, schools and all community institutions share the responsibility for preparing young people for living and learning in <br>
                    a global culture that is increasingly connected through <br>
                    multi-media and influenced by powerful images, words and sounds.<br>
